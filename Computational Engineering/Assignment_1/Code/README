<^>==========================<^>


In this directory there are 4 codes.
1- For the static cylinder.
2- For clockwise rotation cylinder.
3- For anti-clockwise rotation cylinder.
4- Non simetrical stream function around the cylinder (also clock and anticlock changing psi_body).

The changes form 1 to 2 and 3 is just changing the psi_body value, adding +- 1.5. 
Also there is a change in where the ouputs are stored.
The results will be stored in:
Results/Static
Results/Clock
Results/Anticlock

So make sure these directories exist before compiling the code.
The direcotories should be already created in the directory where you opened this README.
More information about all the images of the report (such as paralel flow) can be found
in the link provided at the bottom of the index of the report.
