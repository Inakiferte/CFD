Computational Engineering Assigment 2
<^>==========================<^>


In this directory there are 6 codes.
1- For the paralel flow (not compulsory)
2- For the diagonal flow (uds)
3- For the diagonal flow (eds)
4- For the smith-hutton (uds)
5- For the smith-hutton (eds)
6- For the oulet values

The results will be stored in:
Results/Paralel
Results/Diagonal
Results/S-H

The changes between 2-3 and 4-5 are minimal just changes the used scheme and the plot storing names.
So make sure these directories exist before compiling the code.
The direcotories should be already created in the directory where you opened this README.
