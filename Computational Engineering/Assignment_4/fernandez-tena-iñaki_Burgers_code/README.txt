In this directory there are 2 codes.
1- main.py. Here we make the main plots (shown in the validation part of the report).
2- reynolds.py. Here we make the plots for the reynolds number discussion.

The results will be stored in:
Results/

So make sure this directory exist before compiling the code.
The direcotories should be already created in the directory where you opened this README.
