# CFD
CFD training for the future.

The idea of this repository is to introduce myself into CFD.

Basic CFD = Basic CFD equations solved numerically.

Computational Engineering = CFD works carried out in the Master's in Space and Aeronautical Engineering.

Konpuproject = Navier-Stokes equation solver for a square symmetrical cavity.
